    "Accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions (True Positives + True Negatives) by the total number of predictions. This is visualized using a **confusion matrix**, which is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## The Confusion Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A confusion matrix is the foundation for most classification metrics. It breaks down a model's predictions into four categories. Let's use a **loan approval** model as an example, where the \"positive\" class is \"Approved\" and the \"negative\" class is \"Rejected.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **True Positive (TP)**: The model correctly predicted \"Approved.\" (Actual: Approved, Predicted: Approved)\n",
    "* **True Negative (TN)**: The model correctly predicted \"Rejected.\" (Actual: Rejected, Predicted: Rejected)\n",
    "* **False Positive (FP)**: The model incorrectly predicted \"Approved.\" (Actual: Rejected, Predicted: Approved). This is a **Type I Error**.\n",
    "* **False Negative (FN)**: The model incorrectly predicted \"Rejected.\" (Actual: Approved, Predicted: Rejected). This is a **Type II Error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it looks in a table:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accuracy\n",
    "Accuracy answers the simple question: \"Overall, what percentage of predictions did the model get right?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formula**:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "* **Limitation**: Accuracy can be misleading, especially with **imbalanced datasets**. If a model is trying to detect fraud (a rare event), it can achieve 99% accuracy by simply predicting \"no fraud\" every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NULL Accuracy\n",
    "**NULL Accuracy** is the accuracy that could be achieved by always predicting the most frequent class. For instance, if 95% of loans in your dataset were \"Rejected,\" the NULL accuracy is 95%. Your model's accuracy must be higher than this to be considered useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Key Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Different business problems require us to focus on different types of errors. This is where more specific metrics become crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Precision\n",
    "Precision answers the question: \"Of all the positive predictions, how many were actually correct?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formula**:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "* **Significance**: Precision is important when the cost of a **False Positive** is high.\n",
    "* **Example (Fraud Detection)**: You want high precision. A False Positive (flagging a legitimate transaction as fraud) is very inconvenient for the customer. You want to be very sure that when you predict fraud, it really is fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recall (or Sensitivity)\n",
    "Recall answers the question: \"Of all the actual positive cases, how many did the model correctly identify?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formula**:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "* **Significance**: Recall is important when the cost of a **False Negative** is high.\n",
    "* **Example (Fraud Detection)**: You also want high recall. A False Negative (missing an actual fraudulent transaction) is extremely costly for the business. You want to catch as many fraudulent transactions as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specificity (or Selectivity)\n",
    "Specificity answers the question: \"Of all the actual negative cases, how many did the model correctly identify?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formula**:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "* **Significance**: This is the \"true negative rate\" and is important when you want to correctly identify the negative class. For example, in a medical test for a disease, high specificity means a healthy person is very likely to test negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### F1-Score\n",
    "The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. It provides a single metric that balances both concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formula**:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{F1-Score} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "* **Significance**: It's useful when you need to find a balance between Precision and Recall and don't want to heavily favor one over the other, especially in cases with imbalanced classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Classification Report\n",
    "A **classification report** is a summary of the key metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) for each class in your model. It's a standard output in libraries like Scikit-learn and provides a quick and comprehensive view of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Threshold and Adjusting the Threshold\n",
    "Most classification models, like Logistic Regression, output a probability score (between 0 and 1). The **threshold** is the cutoff value used to convert this probability into a class prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Default Threshold**: Usually 0.5. If the probability is ≥ 0.5, predict positive; otherwise, predict negative.\n",
    "* **Adjusting the Threshold**: This default is not always optimal. By adjusting the threshold, you can trade off Precision for Recall.\n",
    "    * **Increasing the threshold** (e.g., to 0.8) makes the model more \"cautious\" about predicting the positive class. This leads to fewer False Positives (higher Precision) but more False Negatives (lower Recall).\n",
    "    * **Decreasing the threshold** (e.g., to 0.3) makes the model more \"eager\" to predict the positive class. This leads to fewer False Negatives (higher Recall) but more False Positives (lower Precision).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### AUC - ROC Curve 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve** is a plot that visualizes the performance of a classification model at all possible classification thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it plots**:\n",
    "    * **Y-axis**: True Positive Rate (Recall/Sensitivity)\n",
    "    * **X-axis**: False Positive Rate (1 - Specificity)\n",
    "* **What it shows**: The ROC curve shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. A model that is better at distinguishing between classes will have a curve that is closer to the top-left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**AUC (Area Under the Curve)** represents the area under the ROC curve.\n",
    "* **What it means**: AUC is a single number summary of the model's performance across all thresholds. It represents the probability that the model will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance.\n",
    "* **Interpretation**:\n",
    "    * **AUC = 1.0**: Perfect classifier.\n",
    "    * **AUC = 0.5**: Useless classifier (equivalent to random guessing).\n",
    "    * **AUC > 0.7**: Generally considered an acceptable model.\n",
    "    * **AUC > 0.8**: Generally considered a good model."

    "**Univariate feature selection** is a method that selects the best features for a model by evaluating each feature individually against the target variable using statistical tests. It helps combat the **curse of dimensionality**—the problem where model performance degrades as the number of input features becomes too large. This selection process relies on **hypothesis testing** to determine if a statistically significant relationship exists between each feature and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1. Univariate Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is it?\n",
    "This is a feature selection process where each feature is assessed on its own, independent of the others. A statistical test is run for each feature against the target variable (e.g., `age` vs. `salary`, `gender` vs. `purchase_status`). Features are then ranked based on their test scores, and the top-ranking features are selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "This refers to various problems that arise when working with high-dimensional data (datasets with many features). As the number of features increases:\n",
    "* The amount of data needed to support the model grows exponentially.\n",
    "* The model becomes overly complex and is more likely to overfit.\n",
    "* The distance between data points becomes less meaningful.\n",
    "Univariate feature selection helps mitigate this by reducing the number of features to a more manageable and relevant subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis Testing Relation\n",
    "Univariate selection uses statistical hypothesis tests to score features. Each test is framed with:\n",
    "* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: There is **no significant relationship** between the feature and the target.\n",
    "* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: There **is a significant relationship**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test calculates a score and a **p-value**. If the p-value is below a certain threshold (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude the feature is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### F-Test (ANOVA)\n",
    "The F-test, or Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), is used to check if the means of two or more groups are significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### F-Test for Regression (Numerical Target)\n",
    "* **Significance**: It tests if a numerical feature has a significant linear relationship with a numerical target.\n",
    "* **Formula (Conceptual)**:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    F = \\frac{\\text{Variation explained by the feature}}{\\text{Unexplained variation (residuals)}}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "* **Example**: To see if `Years_of_Experience` significantly impacts `Salary`, the F-test checks if the variation in salary explained by experience is greater than the random variation. A high F-score suggests a strong relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### F-Test for Classification (Categorical Target)\n",
    "* **Significance**: It tests if a numerical feature has a significant relationship with a categorical target.\n",
    "* **Example**: To see if `Age` has a significant impact on whether a customer will `Default_on_Loan` (Yes/No), the F-test compares the mean age of the \"Default\" group to the mean age of the \"No Default\" group. If the means are significantly different, the feature is considered important.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Significance and Feature Selection\n",
    "* **How to decide**: After running the F-test, you get an **F-score** and a **p-value**.\n",
    "    * **F-score**: A higher F-score indicates a stronger relationship.\n",
    "    * **p-value**: This is the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis (no relationship) is true.\n",
    "* **Rule for removing features**: If the **p-value is high** (e.g., > 0.05), you fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there's no statistically significant relationship, and you can consider **removing that feature**. Features with low p-values are kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chi-Squared ($\\chi^2$) Test of Independence\n",
    "The Chi-Squared test is used to determine if there is a significant association between two **categorical variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Significance**: It's the primary method for selecting **categorical features** for a **categorical target**.\n",
    "* **Example**: Testing if `Marital_Status` (Married, Single, Divorced) is independent of `Purchased_Product` (Yes/No).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps for Chi-Squared Feature Selection\n",
    "1.  **State Hypotheses**:\n",
    "    * $H_0$: The feature and the target are independent (no relationship).\n",
    "    * $H_1$: The feature and the target are dependent (there is a relationship).\n",
    "2.  **Create a Contingency Table**: A table showing the frequency distribution of the variables (e.g., how many single people purchased the product vs. how many did not).\n",
    "3.  **Calculate the Chi-Squared Statistic**: The test calculates the difference between the observed frequencies and the frequencies that would be expected if the variables were independent.\n",
    "4.  **Determine p-value**: Based on the Chi-Squared statistic, a p-value is calculated.\n",
    "5.  **Select Feature**: If the p-value is low (< 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis and conclude the feature is dependent on the target, meaning it's a useful feature to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 2. Most Common Feature Selection Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "In libraries like Scikit-learn, these statistical tests are wrapped in easy-to-use functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GenericUnivariateSelect`: A configurable selector that allows different selection strategies. More commonly, you use its simpler wrappers:\n",
    "    * `SelectKBest`: Selects a fixed number (`k`) of the top-scoring features.\n",
    "    * `SelectPercentile`: Selects the top features based on a specified percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these, you must provide a `score_func` to tell it which statistical test to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common `score_func` Options:\n",
    "* `f_regression`: Use this for a **regression** task (numerical target). It runs an F-test.\n",
    "* `f_classif`: Use this for a **classification** task (categorical target) when you are testing **numerical features**. It also runs an F-test (ANOVA).\n",
    "* `chi2`: Use this for a **classification** task (categorical target) when you are testing **categorical features**. It runs the Chi-Squared test."
